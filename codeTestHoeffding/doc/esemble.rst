**class Bagging()**
This class is to create a an ensemble method based on bagging for streaming data
This implementation is based on Oza and Russell's Online Bagging Models.

**Parameters:**

n_classifier: Number of different classifiers used for bagging

base_estimator: Base Estimator of the Ensemble Method, such as HoeffdingTree, DecisionTreeClassifier,

buffer_size: Number of streaming instances kept by the buffer as a mini-batch.
